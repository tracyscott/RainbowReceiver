ArtNet LED Controller Simulator for LX Studio

I wrote a quick ArtNet receiver that can take ArtNetDatagram output from LX Studio and render it on screen.
Our LED configuration is only 2D so this works fine for us.  Could be used for 3D also by using P3D.  Regardless,
it is handy for verification of generating packets from your color buffer and also for testing timing.
